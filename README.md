In this short data visualization project, I used two DataFrames from World Population Review 
in order to see if there is any association between the percentage of atheists and the percentage 
of people in poverty, using data on 62 countries. This projects highlights my ability to create 
data visualizations using the libraries pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.
